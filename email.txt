I want to perform a play on the internet. People seem to like the idea.

## Concept
Characters/actors post in an internet channel instead of acting on a stage.
These internet channels provide a wide variation of privacy and media,
allowing complex situations to be conveyed. Moreover, these tools have
become commonplace and each tool has its own connotations.

I got to this idea by pondering the blurring of the distinction between fiction
and reality through games that link to internet social media stuff (and
"gamification") and through movies that link to social media stuff (like those
expermiental HTML5 movies from Google).

## Proposal
Let's choose a particularly well-known play and adapt it to the internet.
Shakespeare's Hamlet seems like a good choice, but that's quite arbitrary.
How do we adapt it?

* Public gatherings happen on Twitter/YouTube/FourSquare/Facebook and so on.
* Private conversations happen on Facebook walls.
* Rumors are retweets/shares/&c.
* Monologues happen in personal blogs.
* Travel is manifest through the location field on these various sites.
* The playwright could assemble these interactions in a Storify.

You'll note that some of these are private places that only a select group can
see. Actors will use their real accounts rather than creating new accounts for
their characters. The audience will be embedded within the performance,
experiencing it from different perspectives based on their existing connections
with the actors.

## You

I suspect that this is a lot easier to put on than a conventional play. A few
people figure out what sorts of people we'd need to play each character,
provide directions for each character, find appropriate people and disseminate
the appropriate information. You might call this writing a script, casting
actors and having one rehearsal. I think that's most of the work; it'll be hard
to rehearse this, so I think the only other thing is the performance.

1. Does this general idea sound interesting?
2. Would you act in it?
3. Does anyone want to work with me on the planning part? I think it would
    help to have someone who knows something about conventional theater.
